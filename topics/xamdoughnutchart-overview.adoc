== Introduction

=== {DoughnutChartName} summary

The  _{DoughnutChartName}_   control is similar to the  pick:[xaml,android=" _xamPieChart_  "]  pick:[win-forms=" _UltraPieChart_  "]  –proportionally illustrating the occurrences of a variable. The  _{DoughnutChartName}_   can display multiple variables in concentric rings, and provides built-in support for visualizing hierarchical data.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
Currently the support for hierarchical data is released as community technology preview (CTP).
